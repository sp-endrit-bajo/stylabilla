# Stylabilla

## What is Stylabilla for?
Stylabilla is the CSS-only styleguide for the [Usabilla](http://www.usabilla.com) product (both public facing widgets and the customer application), that implements our design styleguide ([sketch file](https://drive.google.com/a/usabilla.com/file/d/0B_Xb9pOPqDqzLXJYbzE2a3czbk0/view?usp=sharing), [invision file](https://invis.io/Y2C9FUS6Z)).

It is [inspired by Stripe's approach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=NHpSmJrEvRQ).

## Contributing to Stylabilla
Stylabilla is "internal open source", meaning that we welcome contributions from anyone working at Usabilla. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/usabilla/stylabilla/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute. Most importantly, note that we use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) and therefore any commits with the type "feat" or "fix" or have "BREAKING CHANGE" in the message will automatically release a new version to NPM.

The project is under development and changing all the time and we don't recommend using it in your own projects if you don't work at Usabilla, but it may give you some ideas for your own living styleguide.
