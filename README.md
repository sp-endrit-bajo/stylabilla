# STYLABILLA


## What is Stylabilla for?
Stylabilla is the CSS-only styleguide for the Usabilla product (both public facing widgets and the customer application), that implements our [design styleguide](https://drive.google.com/a/usabilla.com/file/d/0B_Xb9pOPqDqzLXJYbzE2a3czbk0/view?usp=sharing).

It is [inspired by Stripe's approach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=NHpSmJrEvRQ).
